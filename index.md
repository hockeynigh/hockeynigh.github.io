Welcome to my portfolio. Here you will be able to see all the work I have done in iCan to date (the work I can find in my very messy files).

# Lawn Tractor Restoration (Personal Project)

For my personal project I decided to buy an old lawn tractor that was broken for 50$ on marketplace and restore. The goal of this project was to get the tractor running and looking brand new and also adding a sound system to the tractor so you can listen to music while mowing your lawn.
