# Lawn Tractor Restoration (Personal Project)

For my personal project I decided to buy an old lawn tractor that was broken for 50$ on marketplace and restore. The goal of this project was to get the tractor running and looking brand new and also adding a sound system to the tractor so you can listen to music while mowing your lawn.
